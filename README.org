#+TITLE: chez-tortue


Une tortue [ french: tɔʀty ] is a tortoise.  chez-tortue is a
collection of functions I use when scheming.  My implementation of
choice is [[https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme/][chez scheme]] so it is written in this pleasant implementation
of the language scheme.

For now it is really a humble collection of crude scripts, but I hope
one day it can fly.  After all, tortoises are only creatures that can
fly in the underwater.

* How to use

Add chez-tortue directory to your environment variable
~CHEZSCHEMELIBDIR~.  For example if you use emacs, then add

#+begin_src elisp
(setenv "CHEZSCHEMELIBDIRS" "<path-to-chez-tortue-directory>:")
#+end_src
